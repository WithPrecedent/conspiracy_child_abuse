* Introduction
  * Thanks
  * From book project: Sexual Equity
* History
  * Conspiracy theories not new
    * Part of the US founding - pamphleteers for and against the Constitution used a wide range of wholly fictional conspiracies
    * Children have long been focal point of conspiracy theories - in the first century BC, Cicero accused members of the Catiline conspiracy of taking their oaths over a dead boy who they ate and ordered them executed without trial
    * Witch trials in the 15th through 17th centuries accused people of ritualistic child murder
* Satanic Day Care Panic - lasted for over a decade, consumed media attention, numerous trials and convictions (not all allegations involved Satanism, but the defendants were all involved in child care)
* Seeds of the panic were planted here in British Columbia with the publication in 1980 of the now-discredited book "Michelle Remembers", authored by psychologist Lawrence Pazder and his patient Michelle Smith
  * Relied on recovered memory of Smith in therapy with Pazder of ritualistic Satanic abuse (which included rape and sexual assault)
  * Pazder becomes the go-to expert on such abuse and worked with prosecutors in the highest profile trials based on similar allegations in the US
* McMartin Preschool (Manhattan Beach, CA)
  * Prosecutions ran from 1987 to 1990 - no convictions - most expensive set of trials for a single matter in US history at the time
  * 41 of 360 alleged child victims testified at the grand jury
  * Allegations in suggestive and improper interviews included sexual abuse, but also witches flying, underground tunnels where the abuse was alleged to have occurred (but did not exist), and orgies at car washes.
* Media Attention results in a nationwide panic
  * Kern County (California) day care trials led to 36 convvictions of abuse of 60 children, 34 of which were overturned on appeal
  * Fells Acres day care (Massachusetts) resulted in 3 convictions, which were upheld, but doubts remained about the guilt of the defendants because of the use of suggestive interview techniques
  * Country Walk day care (Florida) case included detailed allegations of Satanic abuse - Frank Fuster is still in prison - he is the last person still incarcerated from the Satanic Day Care panic
  * The Bronx Five were accused of sexual abuse at numerous day cares in New York - all 5 convictions were eventually overturned
  * Wee Care Nursery School (New Jersey), Margaret Kelly Michaels was convicted of abusing 33 children, but the NJ Supreme Court overturned her convictions because of suggestive interviews and children being allowed to testify in the judge's chambers
  * Faith Chapel Church ritual abuse case (California) - Dale Akiki, a man with Noonan syndrome and substantial developmental delays was accused of sexual abuse and "killing animals, such as a giraffe and an elephant, and drinking their blood in front of the children" - he was found not guilty
  * Bernard Baran (Massachusetts) was convicted and served 24 years in prison before being exonerated in 2009 (notable prosecutorial misconduct, as in several of these cases)
  * Oak Hill day care (Texas) trial in 1991 - Fran and Dan Keller served 22 years before being freed in 2013 (county settled civil suit by the Kellers for $3.4 million)
* Pizzagate
  * Beginning in 2016, Based on decoding of John Podesta's emails, conspiracy theorists concluded that Comet Pizza in Washington, DC was the hub of a child-sex ring run by Hilary Clinton, Podesta, and other prominent Democrats. Similar to the Satanic Day Care Panic, allegations involved highly ritualized abuse in underground spaces that did not exist
  * Alex Jones, Infowars, and Michael Flynn were prominent figures spreading the conspiracy theory, which came to dominate numerous conservative social media forums
* QAnon
  * Emerges from Pizzagate and concerns aspects beyond the scope of this presentation
  * At its core, though, QAnon alleges that Donald Trump has been leading a secret effort to combat child trafficking by Democrats and other elites involving sexual abuse, child sacrifice, and the extraction of andrenochrome from dead children to extend the lives of those involved in the conspiracy
  * Again, Hilary Clinton and Podesta are at the center of allegations
  * Numerous high-profile Trump advisors and surrogates openly embraced the theory
  * Trump retweeted and "retruths" numerous QAnon accounts
  * Trump himself refuses to condemn the allegations and instead openly welcomes QAnon into his political coalition
  * Polling difficult, but penetration of QAnon beliefs has been substantial (mostly, but not exclusively, among conservatives)
* Separating Fact and Fiction
  * Child Trafficking and Child Sexual Abuse are real
  * Every non-profit focused on child trafficking has struggled with false tips, diversion of funds to fake QAnon charities, and misinformation countering their long-term awareness raising efforts
  * Some conspiracies are true: Tuskegee siphilus experiments + forced sterilization of Native American women (usually without their knowledge)
  * Some are partially true (MKUltra and CIA-Crack)
* Conspiracy vs. Culture
  * How to Lie with Rape Statistics
  * Rape Law Gatekeeping connected data analysis with narratives
  * Conspiracy relies on coordination and coverup - culture doesn't
  * Quality of evidence varies
  * Sir Jimmy Savile
    * Sexual abuse of mostly children over 60 years
    * Took advantage of access to children's charities at hospitals and other locations
    * No reckoning during his lifetime (died at 84 in 2011 as a beloved icon)
    * 2 investigations in his life (first in 1958) and significant presence in whisper networks
    * BBC and police repeatedly ignored and disbelieved accusations (not because of conspiracy, but reflection of culture)
    * Hundreds of victims - actual number unknown
