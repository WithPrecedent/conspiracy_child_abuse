* Introduction
  * Thanks
  * From book project
* History
  * Conspiracy theories not new
    * Part of the US founding - pamphleteers for and against the Constitution used a wide range of wholly fictional conspiracies
    * Children have long been focal point of conspiracy theories - in the first century BC, Cicero accused members of the Catiline conspiracy of taking their oaths over a dead boy who they ate and ordered them executed without trial
    * Witch trials in the 15th through 17th centuries accused people of ritualistic child murder
* Satanic Day Care Panic
  * Seeds of the panic were planted here in Canada with the publication in 1980 of the now-discredited book "Michelle Remembers", authored by psychologist Lawrence Pazder and his patient Michelle Smith
    * Relied on recovered memory of Smith in therapy with Pazder of ritualistic Satanic abuse (which included rape and sexual assault)
    * Pazder becomes the go-to expert on such abuse and worked with prosecutors in the highest profile trials based on similar allegations in the US
